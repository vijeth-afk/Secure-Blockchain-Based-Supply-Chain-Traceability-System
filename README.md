## Introduction

### What is a Blockchain?

<p align="justify">Blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized digital ledger that enables safe, transparent transaction recording and verification by numerous parties. It was initially presented as the core technology of the well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Its promise goes far beyond virtual currency, though. A blockchain is fundamentally made up of a series of blocks, each of which has a list of transactions on it. Cryptographic methods are used to connect these blocks, resulting in an unchangeable and impenetrable record of every transaction. Because of its decentralized structure, transactions may be verified and validated without the need of a central authority like a bank or government.</p>

### What is a Supply Chain?

<p align="justify">The network of all the people, companies, assets, processes, and technological advancements involved in developing and providing a good or service from suppliers to consumers is known as a supply chain. It includes every step of the process, from locating raw materials to shipping the finished good to the customer. While minimizing costs, efficient supply chain management guarantees that the appropriate product is delivered at the right time, in the right amount, and in the desired quality. Businesses must manage this intricate worldwide network of distributors, manufacturers, suppliers, and shipping companies in order to satisfy consumer needs and stay competitive.</p>

## Architecture Diagram

<div align="center">
  <img src="/client/public/Architecture Diagram.jpeg">
</div>
<br>

<p align="justify">
  The proposed Blockchain-based Supply Chain System, consists of several steps, including Goods Node Registration, Client Communication, and Good Verification. The registration process involves verifying the authenticity of goods, such as checking against or verifying the identity of the supplier. Stakeholders, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, also register on the platform, providing unique identifiers for tracking their activities.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Client Communication utilizes Web3.js to facilitate seamless interaction with local or remote Ethereum nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket. Goods Verification integrates the system's digital signature against the Owner's public key to ensure transaction authenticity. This ensures that only the Owner has the authority to initiate orders, maintaining the integrity and security chain.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Blockchain Chain Creation uses Ethereum's blockchain technology to create immutable records, recording each transaction or update as a block on the blockchain. A User Interface for Product Status Updates is implemented using React.js, ensuring real-time updates on product status. The Supply Chain Flow represents the flow of goods through the supply chain, with each stakeholder having unique access to update their statuses.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Transactional Data Storage ensures that all transactional data is securely stored in a database, enhancing transparency among all stakeholders in the supply chain. The database can be implemented using traditional database technologies or a distributed database spread across multiple nodes in the network.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  MetaMask Wallet Integration facilitates transactions within the Ethereum blockchain environment, allowing users to interact with the blockchain, including sending and receiving transactions and interacting with smart contracts. Truffle Environment simplifies the development process of Ethereum-based applications by providing built-in smart contracts with the Solidity programming language, compilation, linking, deployment, and binary management.
</p>

## Working of the Smart Contract

<div align="center">
  <img src="/client/public/contractD.png" />
</div>
<br />

<p align="justify">
  This diagram illustrates a supply chain process that incorporates blockchain technology for registration and tracking of transactions. The supply chain involves several key entities: Raw Material Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, and the end Customer. The left side of the diagram shows the registration process to add participants to the blockchain. Each entity (Raw Material Supplier, Manufacture, Distributor, Retailer) goes through a registration process where their address is verified. If the address invalid, they are not registered. If the address is valid, they are verified and registered on the blockchain.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The right side of the diagram depicts the traditional supply chain flow, starting from the Raw Material Supplier, then to the Manufacture, followed by the Distributor, and finally to the Retailer, who seels the product to the Customer. All transactions that occur throughout the supply chain process are recorded on a shared ledger, which is visible to any node (participant) in the blockchain network. This ledger provides transparency and traceability for every transaction that takes place within the supply chain.

## Additional Information

### Ethereum Chain

<p align="justify">
  The Ethereum Chain, sometimes known as Ethereum, is an open-source decentralized blockchain platform that facilitates the development of decentralized applications (DApps) for smart contracts. Vitalik Buterin came up with the idea in 2013 and it was formally introduced in 2015. Ethereum is fundamentally a distributed ledger system running on an international node network. Unlike traditional centralized systems, Ethereum relies on a vast network of computers, known as nodes, to confirm and record transactions, guaranteeing security and openness.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Ethereum is unique in that it supports Self-executing contracts with preset terms and conditions are known as smart contracts. Solidity is an Ethereum-specific programming language used to write these contracts. Smart Contracts enable automation and trust in various applications, from financial services to supply chain management. Ethereum uses a cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) to facilitate transactions and incentivize network participants, such as miners and developers. Ether can also be used to pay for computational services within the Ethereum network.
</p>

### Solidity

<p align="justify">
  Solidity is a high-level, statically typed programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves and automate and enforce blockchain transactions based on predefined criteria and conditions. Solidity serves as primary language for developing these smart contracts, and it's crucial components of the Ethereum ecosystem. Solidity's design is influenced by JavaScript and Python, making it accessible to developers familiar with these languages. It provides tools and structure for defining the logic of smart contracts, including functions, data types and control structures.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  One of Solidity's core functions is its ability to handle complex financial and business logic within smart contracts. Developers can create custom tokens, manage digital assets, and establish intricate governance systems all executed autonomously on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity promotes security through built-in features like access control, overflow protection, and automated checked to prevent common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy protection, and automated checked to prevent common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks. However, it also requires a deep understanding of blockchain concepts to write secure and efficient contracts. In conclusion, Solidity is a specialized programming language empowering developers to craft smart contracts for Ethereum and other compatible blockchain platforms.
</p>

### Truffle Environment

<p align="justify">
  Truffle, while currently in its sunset phase, played a pivotal role in shaping the development landscape for blockchain applications, particularly on the Ethereum platform. It provided a comprehensive and user-friendly environment, streamlining the process from initial coding to deployment and testing. This made it a popular choice for developers, fostering innovation and contributing significantly to the growth of blockchain technology.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  At its core, Truffle functioned as a dedicated workspace for blockchain projects. Developers could leverage its built-in features to seamlessly handle various tasks. Compiling smart contracts, the core building blocks of blockchain applications, was made effortless. Linking these contracts together and deploying them to diverse blockchain networks, both public and private, was facilitated through intuitive workflows. Additionally, Truffle integrated established testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai, allowing developers to rigorously test their smart contracts and ensure their functionality within the complex blockchain environment.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Beyond these core functionalities, Truffle offered a powerful console for real-time interaction with the blockchain. This empowered developers to test smart contract functions directly, inspect variables, and debug issues in hands-on manner. The user-friendly interface further simplified the process of deploying and managing contract updates through scripted deployments and migrations.
</p>

### React.js

<p align="justify">
  React, an open-source JavaScript library developed and maintained by Meta, stands as a dominant force in the realm of front-end development. Its component-based architecture empowers developers to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UIs) in a modular and reusable fashion. This approach fosters maintainability, scalability, and a streamlined development experience. At its core, React leverages the concept of “components,” self-contained and reusable pieces of UI that encapsulates both HTML structure and logic.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  These components can be nested and combined, forming the building blocks of complex web applications. This modularity promotes code organization, reusability, and independent development, making it easier for teams to collaborate and build large-scale applications efficiently. Another key features of React is its virtual DOM (Document Object Model). This in-memory representation of the actual DOM allows React to efficiently calculate the minimal changes needed to update the UI whenever data changes. This optimization translates to faster rendering and a smoother user experience, especially in applications with frequent updates.
</p>

### MetaMask Wallet

<p align="justify">
  MetaMask is a widely-used cryptocurrency wallet and a browser extension that enables users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum blockchain. In the context of this project, MetaMask serves as a secure gateway for supply chain stakeholders to authenticate themselves and participate in the blockchain-based supply chain management system. By leveraging MetaMask, stakeholders can securely sign transactions and execute smart contract functions related to various supply chain operations, such as tracking product movements, verifying authenticity, and recording custody transfers. The integration with MetaMask ensures that these transactions are cryptographically signed and validated, maintaining integrity and immutability of supply chain data recorded on Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, MetaMask enables stakeholders to manage their Ethereum-based cryptocurrency holdings, which can be used to pay transaction fees or facilitate secure value transfers within the supply chain ecosystem, if required.
</p>

### Node.js

<p align="justify">
  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. In the context of this project, Node.js is used to build the backend server, which acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the Ethereum blockchain. One of the primary responsibilities of the Node.js backend is to facilitate communication between the client-side application (built with React.js) and the Ethereum blockchain network. This communication is achieved through the integration of Web3.js, a JavaScript library that provides a convenient way to interact with Ethereum nodes.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The Node.js backend utilizes Web3.js to establish a connection with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling the execution of various operations such as deploying and interacting with smart contracts, sending transactions, and retrieving data from the blockchain. This functionality is crucial for managing and tracking the supply chain data stored on the Ethereum network. Additionally, the Node.js backend handles user authentication and authorization processes. By leveraging the Ethereum stakeholder addresses as digital identities, the backend can verify and grant access to authenticated stakeholders, ensuring the security and integrity of the supply chain management system.
